                <p>Abdul Qadeer Khan[a] NI, HI, FPAS (1 April 1936 – 10 October 2021)[3] was a Pakistani nuclear
                    physicist and metallurgical engineer. He is colloquially known as the "father of Pakistan's atomic
                    weapons program".[b]

                    A Muhajir emigrant from India who migrated to Pakistan in 1952, Khan was educated in the
                    metallurgical engineering departments of Western European technical universities where he pioneered
                    studies in phase transitions of metallic alloys, uranium metallurgy, and isotope separation based on
                    gas centrifuges. After learning of India's "Smiling Buddha" nuclear test in 1974, Khan joined his
                    nation's clandestine efforts to develop atomic weapons when he founded the Khan Research
                    Laboratories (KRL) in 1976 and was both its chief scientist and director for many years.
